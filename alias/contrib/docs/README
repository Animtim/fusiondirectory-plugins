What does this plugin ?
************************

It manage mail alias based on LDAP and used by postfix 

it use a special branch in LDAP : ou=aliases, you could specify it inside fusiondirectory.conf

aliasRDN="ou=aliases"


A special LDAP schema has been created. It just add a date when to destroy this alias,
useful when a lot of peoples go away but need to be joined by officiel email address 
and a description


How to convert existing aliases in LDAP

1/ export LDAP alias branch to alias.ldif file
2/ run " sed -i s/nisMailAlias/nisMailAlias\\nobjectClass\:\ mailAliases/g /tmp/alias.ldif"
3/ import LDAP file

Why aliaseExpirationDate attribute ?
this a features useful if we want to keep some aliases during a fix duration (avoid to have several zombie aliases)
